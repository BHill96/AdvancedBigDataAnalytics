# AdvancedBigDataAnalytics
This repository is for the CGU class Advanced Big Data Analytics. The three team members are Blake Hillier, Grace Li, and Joe Puhalla. Each folder contains all the data, code, and report for the appropriate homework assignment.
1. Class Notes - Contains the typed section of notes assigned to our group
2. HW2 - Given 100 stocks calculate singular values for different combinations and cluster them into groups
3. Midterm - Contains paper summaries, data, and code used to create our Midterm Project
4. Final - Contains paper summaries, data, and code used to create our Final Project

Throughout this class we had two projects. Our first project was Forecasting Stock Price Using Sentiment Analysis and LSTM Networks for our midterm. It was a proof of concept for a forcasting model using sentiment analsys and macroeconomic data. Our main result was how using XLNet cut our error in half. We have a Colab notebook which will run our main model as well as the individual models and reproduce their graphs.
